# Formula 1 Data Analysis and Visualization

This project is a collection of Python scripts designed to analyze and visualize Formula 1 race data. It leverages the [FastF1](https://theoehrly.github.io/Fast-F1/) library to fetch and process data, and uses libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating insightful visualizations.

## Scripts

The project includes the following scripts:

*   `driver_pace.py`: Ranks and visualizes driver race pace.
*   `qualifying_results.py`: Plots qualifying results, highlighting the fastest lap times and differences.
*   `tyre_strategies.py`: Visualizes the tyre strategies employed by each driver during a race.
*   `gear_shifts.py`: Analyzes and visualizes gear shift patterns.
*   `position_changes.py`: Tracks and plots position changes throughout a race.
*   `team_pace.py`: Compares and visualizes the race pace of different teams.
*   `overlaying_speed_traces.py`: Overlays speed traces of different laps or drivers for comparison.
*   `speed_vizualisation.py`: Creates visualizations of speed data.
*   `driver_laptimes_scatterplot.py`: Generates scatter plots of driver lap times.
